# Ġabra Converter

This program converts [Ġabra](https://mlrs.research.um.edu.mt/resources/gabra/)'s [database dump files](https://mlrs.research.um.edu.mt/resources/gabra-api/p/download), which are for [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), into a more accessible format, as well as cleaning and normalising it.


## How to use

To use this program, you will need to have the following command line commands available on your computer:

- `tar`: [7-zip archiver](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html)
- `bsondump`: [MongoDB tool](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/installation/installation/)

Make sure that you install the above applications and then test them in your command line / terminal with the following commands:

- `tar --version`
- `bsondump --version`

Once you have these applications available in your command line / terminal, you can now download a [Ġabra database dump file](https://mlrs.research.um.edu.mt/resources/gabra-api/p/download).
